# Hi, I'm Jason 👋

I'm a **computer science student** and aspiring software engineer interested in learning how real-world software systems are designed and built.

I enjoy working on projects that help me understand **backend logic, APIs, data modeling**, and how different parts of a system fit together.

## Tech I've worked with
**Backend**
- PHP
- Python
- .NET
- REST APIs
- SQL (MySQL, PostgreSQL)
- NoSQL
